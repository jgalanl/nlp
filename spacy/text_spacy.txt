Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón (born 29 February 1972) is a Spanish politician serving as Prime Minister of Spain since 2 June 2018. On 7 January 2020, Pedro Sanchez was confirmed by the Congress of Deputies as Prime Minister with a lead of just two votes (167 to 165), at the helm of the first coalition government since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s, ending the political deadlock that included two inconclusive elections.He has also been Secretary-General of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) since June 2017, having previously held that office from 2014 to 2016.
He served as a Madrid city councillor from 2004 to 2009, before being elected to the Congress of Deputies. In 2014, he became Secretary-General of the PSOE, becoming the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 and 2016 general elections. Sánchez resigned as Secretary-General after disagreements with the party's executive, and was re-elected the following year during a series of primaries, defeating Susana Díaz and Patxi López.
On 31 May 2018, the PSOE filed a no confidence motion in the Rajoy II Government in the Congress of Deputies, which was passed the following day with the support of Unidas Podemos and the leader of the party Pablo Iglesias, as well as various regionalist and nationalist parties. Sánchez was subsequently sworn in as Prime Minister of Spain by Felipe VI on 2 June. He led his party to gain 38 seats in the April 2019 general election, the PSOE's first national victory since 2008, a victory re-validated at the subsequent November 2019 general election.
